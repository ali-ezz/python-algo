# Algorithms Tasks 🧮

This repository contains my university algorithms assignment where I implemented two classic problems **from scratch**, without using built-in Python functions:

## 📌 Task Details
- **Project name**: Algorithms Tasks
- **Course**: Algorithms (COMXXX)
- **Grade weight**: 10 points
- **Rules**: No plagiarism, no built-in sort, max, etc.

## ✏️ Implemented Algorithms

### 1️⃣ Max Product of Three
Given a non-empty zero-indexed array A, find the maximal product of any triplet (P, Q, R).  
**Example:**
- Input: `[1,2,3,4]`
- Output: `24`

Includes:
- Pseudocode
- Algorithm analysis
- Time complexity calculation

---

### 2️⃣ Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the median of the merged sorted array.  
**Example:**
- Input: `nums1 = [1, 3]`, `nums2 = [2]`
- Output: `2`

Includes:
- Pseudocode
- Algorithm analysis
- Time complexity calculation
